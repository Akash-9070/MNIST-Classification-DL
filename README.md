# MNIST-Classification-DL
The MNIST Classification Code Project aims to develop a deep learning model using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset, a cornerstone in the machine learning community, consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits ranging from 0 to 9.
